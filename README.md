# Telegraf Docker Image with Net-SNMP

Telegraf is an agent for collecting metrics and writing them to InfluxDB or other outputs. The reason why I created this repository ([Docker Hub link](https://hub.docker.com/r/nuntz/telegraf-snmp/)) is that the official one does not include the SNMP MIBs, used by the `input.snmp` input plugin.

Based on:

THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED.
